# Monthly Global Land-Surface Temperature

This repository contains the code used to create a choropleth test map of land surfaces around the world, from 1753 to 2015.

The heat map was created with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) "Data Visualization with D3" curriculum.

The [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json) was provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Enjoy!
