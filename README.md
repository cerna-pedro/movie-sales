# United States Educational Attainment

This repository contains the code used to create a tree map of the USA, showing the percentage of adults age 25 and older who have attained a bachelor's degree or higher, from 2010 to 2014.

The choropleth map was created with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) "Data Visualization with D3" curriculum.

The data was provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
