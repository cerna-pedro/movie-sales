# Movie Sales

This repository contains the code used to create a tree map of movie sales, for certain movies.

The tree map was created with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) "Data Visualization with D3" curriculum.

The [data](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/tree_map/movie-data.json) was provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
